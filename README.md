# Hi, I'm Fran ðŸ‘‹

I am an economist and data scientist working as a doctoral research associate at the Institute of Behavioral Science and Technology (IBT) at the University of St. Gallen. 

I love to acquire new knowledge, especially related to economics, finance, and technology, on top of sharing such knowledge in a simple, concise, and innovative way. As Richard Feynman said:

> "If you want to master something, teach it."

Moreover, I love programming, especially in R and Python, which I usually use to analyze data and automate different tasks. 

In my spare time, I write on my blog, [ZeroInterest](https://zerointerest.ch/), in which I write about economics, finance, and computer science.
